# Basic Calculator

The Basic Calculator project is an interactive web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator features a user-friendly interface that allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The design employs a CSS grid system for optimal button alignment, ensuring a seamless user experience. The calculator includes a display screen that dynamically shows user input and calculated results.

JavaScript powers the functionality, utilizing event listeners to capture user interactions and if-else statements to process operations. The project demonstrates a solid understanding of handling user input, performing calculations, and implementing loops where necessary.

This project not only enhances my web development skills but also serves as a practical example of how to create interactive applications using fundamental web technologies.
